# AI Sight Quest

AI Sight Quest is an iOS application powered by Artificial Intelligence that leverages Machine Learning models and Apple's Frameworks. It enables users to take a photo and capture the text using [Apple's Vision Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) and locate relevant passages in a document by asking the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model a question.
